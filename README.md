# Springboot_Mybatis_Junit
Junit mybatis mapper test in Springboot.

This is only using mybatis mapper sample project.
You just only create xml mapper file and java interface.
Awesome, but you have to question why are they running so simply.
No think, no gain haha~~~

In my case
  Springboot is 1.5.4.RELEASE
  Mybatis is mybatis-spring-boot-starter, 1.3.0
Do you want more configuration. to see 'build.gradle' file

First, You change datasource information in src/main/resources/eapplication.yml.
'your server info' is your db server url
'your username' is your database username
'your password' is your database password
